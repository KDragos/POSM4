# Milestone 4 PHP Project: A POS System

## Description
For this milestone we will build a point-of-sale (POS) system that a retailer might use to keep track of customers, invoices, and the items that are for sale. This project will be *very* light on visual design and will focus on database interactions. The project will consist of a set of pages that allows the store owner to manage customers, items, and invoices.

## Process
We will do a project design session in class where we will accomplish these goals:
- identify the needs of the store owner
- design a page-flow that will satisfy the needs
- design the controls of each page
- design the database schema for the project

After our design session, the teachers will provide design documentation for our design and a file that contains all of the necessary create table statements for the database. All design docs will be posted in this repository.
